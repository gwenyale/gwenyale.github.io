Hi. It's been a while.

Remember when I said weekly? Yeah, me too.

And here's the thing, I don't have a good excuse.

I could tell you that starting my last semester of school was stressful, and it
is, but it's an excuse. I spend approximately 9 hours a week in class. That
equals maybe another 9 hours for homework. Maybe. Add in a few random hours a
here and there for work, and a large amount of time is completely
unaccounted for. What do I do with it? Honestly, I don't know where it all goes,
but I do know I have more time for writing than I think I do. That's why I made
the goal I did, and now it's time to stick to it.

So the real question is, why wasn't I writing?

It's both as simple and as complicated as this: I hate sharing deep feelings.
I'm great at the surface sharing:

I'm excited to go skiing
I'm nervous for a test
I'm stressed about post graduation life

A short emotion that can be explained in one word, is not post-worthy. I want to
write about the panic-inducing fear, along with strong waves of nostalgia, that
is second semester senior year. But if I'm not sharing that with my closest
friends, how can I share that with strangers on the internet?

Let's find out.
