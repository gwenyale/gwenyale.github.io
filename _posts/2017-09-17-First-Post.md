title: How Do You Start A Blog?
tags: [first post]
---

Crazy determination, in my case. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve come up with the perfect blog idea, tried to write a few posts, only to drop it the next week. Here’s to hoping this one lasts longer.

This time, I’m not sticking to one theme. It’ll be different, and harder, because of this. I plan to write about my life, my creative writing, and my book. Thrown in there might be more than that, but we’ll see how this goes. I’m hoping less rigid guidelines about what I have to write, will help me write more? It’s a working theory.

I could try and promise you a post a week or every two weeks or something, but let’s be real. School has just started again, senior year hit hard, and I’m not sure I was ready. So I promise that I will do my best to post, and when I do, I’ll put everything I have into it. I won’t be posting just to post.

So what do I write for this post, that was the question. I don’t have a following, and more than likely less than 15 people, basically my close friends and family will read this. What do my non-existent followers want to hear, what will start off this adventure for me?  

How about a little bit about me? I’m 21, I go to a liberal arts college getting my degree in english (wow, big surprise right?) and I am super involved in my school…. Okay this sounds boring typing it. There is no way for you, my lovely reader, to get to know me faster or better by listing off my involvements and hobbies, I guess you’ll just have to stay tuned.
